\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}
\textit{What's OTP?}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the goal of OTP?
\item What are the ``design principles'' of OTP?
\item How is it used?
\end{itemize}

\textit{How does this interact with Erlang}
\begin{itemize}
\item What parts of Erlang/BEAM is ``needed'' for implementing OTP? (processes,
  traps, mailboxes \& etc.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}
\textit{Will probably have a similar structure to the Suture blog-post}
\begin{itemize}
\item What parts of OTP are we interested in porting.
\item How does this translate to Rust?
\item What does Rust make easier/harder?
\item What different things could an implementation focus on?
  \textit{Like performance, robustness, idiomaticity, expressiveness, ergonomics}.

  We'll try to find out whether it \textit{can} be done idiomaticly and ergonomically.

\item What have we chosen to focus on?
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Talk about what an OTP implementation overall consists of (in general)
\item Talk about our high-level design/implementation
\item Talk about some concrete implementation decisions (and what drove them)
\item Go into some (few) low-level technical details that might be interesting
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item High-level architecture (with nice diagrams \texttt{:)})
\item Motivation, i.e. what does this example demonstrate
\item What does this example show/what can we observe/conclude from it
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item What does idiomatic Rust look like? (2 parts, the implementation of OTP
  and the usage of our library)
\item How expressive is the library?
\item How easy is it to implement common patterns, in terms of ergonomics (code
  length, complexity, etc)?
\item How easy is it to understand written code?
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
